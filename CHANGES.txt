Pangool Change Log
====================

Pangool 0.60 (DEVELOPMENT)
 IMPROVEMENTS
  - 2012-01-07 - Nulls support. Now you can declare fields as nullable in schemas. Routines for
                 serializing and performing the proper comparison between nulls and objects
                 is properly provided.
  - 2012-01-16 - Deep copy support for Tuples

 BUG FIXES
  - 2012-01-22 - Changed default instances folder to user-located folder ./pangool-instances . 
		 Before it was /tmp which caused users who didn't have access to it in the HDFS
		 to fail with this default value.
  - 2012-01-22 - SolrOutputFormat needed to use an explicit absolute Path for a strange behavior 
		 in Cygwin to be solved.

Pangool 0.50.1

 IMPROVEMENTS
 - 2012-12-24 - TupleMRBuilder was not creating a copy of the Configuration object it received.
		While this may seem irrelevant, it is important as you might want to execute Jobs
		in parallel and share some common Configuration. But it wasn't possible to do that.
 - 2013-01-02 - DCUtils refactored to InstancesDistributor. No more use of postfixing.
 - 2013-01-04 - Added method "cleanupInstanceFiles" in TupleMRBuilder and MapOnlyJobBuilder for 
		actively deleting temporary instance files in HDFS generated by Pangool.
 
 BUG FIXES
 - 2012-12-12 - On mappers, when user overwritting a "string" field with a String,
                there were a casting exception. Now it is detected and a new Utf8 is created.

Pangool 0.5

 IMPROVEMENTS
 - 2012-11-27 - TupleFile for reading SequenceFiles with Tuples, natively, without using
                Avro. So, from this version Avro is not mandatory anymore.
              - Rewritten TupleInputFormat & TupleOutputFormat to use the new TupleFile

 BUG FIXES
 - 2012-11-20 - Integers or longs with "+" at the start failed with
                TupleTextInputFormat
 - 2012-11-21 - Improved TupleTextInputFormat. Better handling of escaping
                and quotes

Pangool 0.43.5

 BUG FIXES
 - 2012-10-30 - Solr 4.0 dependency introduced jcl-over-slf4j as depedency.
                That is completely incompatible with Hadoop, as Hadoop uses
                a very old version of commons-logging.
 - 2012-11-12 - Skip header in TupleTextInputFormat was not working. Solved.

 IMPROVEMENTS
 - 2012-10-30 - Changed TupleTextInputFormat for being able to support compression in input files and added a unit test for it.
 - 2012-10-29 - Improved TupleTextInputFormat wiht a custom CSV Tokenizer for being able to handle nulls and differentiate them from empty strings.
 - 2012-11-08 - TupleTextInputFormat now supports fixed width fields input
                files.

 CHANGES
 - 2012-10-30 - Mark Solr as optional dependency on pom.xml. That means 
                that projetcs using this functionality should explicitely
                declare Solr as dependency.
 - 2012-10-30 - Change Hadoop dependency scope to "provided" in order to
                reduce conflicts with other Hadoop library versions.

Pangool 0.43.4

 BUG FIXES

 CHANGES
 - 2012-10-09 - Migrated to Solr 4.0.0-BETA
